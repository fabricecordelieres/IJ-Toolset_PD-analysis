#### Data structure for output
The toolset will output many data. In order to keep everything sorted, a specific folder/subfolders structure is adopted. The datastructure is generated as the user is activating the different tools. For each of the following folders, a subfolder is created per lif file and contains one file per sequence. This data structure is hosted in a user-defined root folder.

## How to install/use it ?

The [release page](https://github.com/fabricecordelieres/IJ-Toolset_PD-analysis/releases/tag/v1.0) displays a download link for PD-analysis_Workflow.zip file. Once unzipped, it contains everything that needs to be installed.

*The toolset mostly relies on functions and plugins that are already embarqued within Fiji. Tool 3, however, requires a separate plugin that should be installed before using the toolset:*
1. Download [Zip_It.jar](https://github.com/fabricecordelieres/IJ-Plugin_Zip-It/releases/tag/v1.0).
3. Drag-and-drop the .jar file to your ImageJ/Fiji toolbar.
4. In the File saver window, press Ok.
5. Restart Fiji/ImageJ.

*The toolset installation is quite straightforward:*
1. Copy/Paste the toolset file to Fiji's installation folder, in macros/toolset.
3. Under the ImageJ toolbar, on the right-most side, click on the red double arrow and select the appropriate toolset (choose "Startup macro" to go back to the original status).
4. Default ImageJ tools have partly been replaced by your toolset's buttons.

To use the toolset, first activate it, then press the buttons.
